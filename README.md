# Case-Study-Analyzing-Healthcare-Data-in-Tableau
I explored a real-world dataset to uncover hospital efficiency insights for a fictional consulting company called HealthStat.

Course Description: In healthcare, improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority. In this Tableau Case study, you’ll explore a real-world dataset to uncover hospital efficiency insights for a fictional consulting company called HealthStat. You’ll analyze attributes impacting the **patient length of stay** (LOS) and cost and work to identify factors contributing to hospital differences. You’ll leverage your Tableau skills to create measures and generate insightful visualizations. To finish off, you’ll bring it all together in a sophisticated **business dashboard** to communicate insights for the **HealthStat** team. This case study gives you a chance to practice a range of Tableau skills, working with real-world data.

Steps:
1. Healthcare Analysis in Tableau: To kick off this case study, you’ll bring the data into Tableau. You’ll learn about measuring efficiency in healthcare, and after a quick check-up on the dataset content, you’ll get started with some initial exploratory analytics. Then, you’ll leverage your Tableau skills to do some comparison analyses.
2. Analyzing Hospital Performance and Benchmarking: Roll up your sleeves and scrub in—it’s time to get operating on some insights! This chapter is all about identifying hospital performance outliers and revealing what attributes most influence length of stay and cost per patient discharge. Along the way, you’ll sharpen your Tableau skills by building some more complex calculated fields.
3. Creating a dynamic dashboard: In this final chapter, you’ll focus on building your final dashboard into a cohesive and interactive report. You’ll incorporate the HealthStat branding for an appealing display, optimize user-friendly navigation features, and close off by adding a dynamic title.
